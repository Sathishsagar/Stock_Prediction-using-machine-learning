# Stock_Prediction-using-machine-learning
Stock Price Prediction Using Machine Learning and Deep Learning This project focuses on predicting stock prices using Machine Learning and Deep Learning techniques. It leverages advanced models like Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to analyze historical stock price data and predict future values with improved accuracy.

Key Features:
Data Acquisition Module: Fetch and preprocess historical stock price data (Open, High, Low, Close, Volume).

Prediction Model: Implemented using LSTM for time series forecasting and comparative analysis with other models like Random Forest (RF).

Graphical User Interface (GUI): A user-friendly interface to input stock data, run predictions, and visualize results through interactive charts.

Performance Evaluation: Evaluate models based on accuracy metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and RMSE.

Tools and Technologies:
Python (Keras, TensorFlow, Sklearn, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib)
Deep Learning: LSTM, GRU
Machine Learning: Random Forest (RF)
Data Visualization: Plotly, Matplotlib
Future Enhancements:
Integration of financial news sentiment analysis for improved predictions.
Real-time data acquisition and forecasting.
How to Run:
Clone the repository.
Install required libraries using pip install -r requirements.txt.
Run the main script to launch the GUI and start predictions.
This project is an ideal tool for investors, analysts, and researchers interested in predicting stock market trends.
To run the project after running code type in terminal Streamlit run app.py
